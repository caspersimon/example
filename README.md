Welcome to the team! As a student influencer, you will create videos videos that will hopefully do well on social media. How any video will perform on social media is hard to predict, but there are certain best practices that can help to create the best video possible. Here, you will learn some tips and things to keep in mind when you create videos.

This e-learning is split up into three parts. First, you will learn some of the key aspects to think about when you create a video. Second, you will see some examples of how you can use texts, cuts, zoom-ins and B-roll footage to see how this is brought into practice. Finally, you will follow a tutorial to create an engaging video yourself!

# Fundamentals
Most of the content we see today is served to us by an algorithm that decides which videos are of high quality and which ones are not. There are two key aspects to think about: *retention* and *engagement*. 

What follows is an overview of practical tips. It is not possible to incorporate every one of them into every video, but they serve as a general guideline of what to think about.
## Retention
**Retention** relates to how long someone watches your video. When someone watches more of your video, this informs the algorithm that it is of high quality. Below, there are some things you can think about to increase retention.
### Title
From the moment your video pops up on someones feed, your video needs to catch someones attention. You can do this by adding a big title that welcomes people to continue watching. 

A good way to do this is by **making clear what the viewer can gain** from watching your video. You can think of titles such as:
- *Study spots in Amsterdam ✨*
- *Websites that will help you with your ✨research✨*
- *✨Student room tour✨ - Former prison edition*

All these titles catch people's attention by making it clear that they can get useful information by watching this video, or in case of the last title it catches people's attention because it is somewhat unexpected and therefore interesting.

Another good strategy for coming up with titles is structuring your video into **numbered lists**. This immediately makes clear what someone can expect from your video, and that makes someone more willing to invest their attention into it. Examples include:
- *3 steps to never fail exams again*
- *Week of lectures - Economics and Business Economics at University of Amsterdam* 
  This video showed Monday through Friday, which is also some kind of structured list.

**TL;DR:**
Create a title that makes it clear which value it provides to the viewer and sets expectations for what they will see.
### Pacing
You've heard it before: people's attention spans are not what they used to be. That is why it is important that your video does not bore people.

**Pacing** is about the speed at which your video delivers information. To maximise retention, it is important that your viewer does not get bored. There should *almost* be an overload of information. This means:
- The interesting part of your video should start as soon as possible
- Your video should have little to no silent moments
- Texts should be on screen so users can read while they watch your video. These texts should only last a couple of seconds so people do not get bored.
- Clips should only last for a few seconds

Do not be afraid that your video delivers information too fast. If you have ever been on TikTok, you have likely seen videos that consist of subway surfers gameplay combined with some other video. People can handle large amounts of information.

In the next two chapters, we will look at some examples of how you can get the pacing of your video right.
### Music
Most videos have some music playing in the background. This can help with the pacing of your videos.

There are some studies that suggest the perception of time and the tempo of music are related. When people hear music with a slow tempo, they perceive time to move faster than when they hear music with a high tempo (and vice versa) (add references).

You can use this to your advantage. You want your viewer to perceive time as fast-moving, so it is (usually) better to avoid music with a higher BPM. But ultimately, the music you choose depends on the type of video you make. Try out a few different songs and see what fits best!

To find music you can use on TikTok and Instagram, there are a few resources I can recommend:
1. **Youtube's audio library**. You can find it by heading over to https://studio.youtube.com/ and then navigating to the audio library. Make sure you filter for music for which attribution is not required. 
   What is great about YouTube's audio library is that the music in here can usually be used on every platform, so also on TikTok and Instagram. You can also download the music to be used right in your editor, which is convenient.
2. **Meta's sound collection** https://www.facebook.com/sound/collection
   Like YouTubes's audio library, you can find and download audio to use. Unlike YouTube's audio library, you might not be allowed to use the music on TikTok as well. It might take some digging to find out whether a song is also allowed on TikTok.
3. **TikTok's commercial audio library** https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/music/pc/en
   You can use this website to find music, but it does not allow you to download the music into your own projects. So when you want to use a song from here, you should tell Bridget and she'll add it in during the posting of this video.
   Also, not every song in here can also be used on Instagram. It might take some digging to find out whether a song is also on Instagram.
## Engagement
**Engagement** relates to whether people like, comment, save and/or share a video. Ideally, you create your video in a way that invites people to press all the buttons.
### Optimising for shares and saves
People share and save funny, relatable, unexpected, and/or useful videos
